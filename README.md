# Artistic Tinder

## Project Overview

**Artistic Tinder** is a web application built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, designed to help users explore different images based on search queries. The app allows users to **like** or **dislike** images (swiping right or left). Users can search for images such as logos, website designs, posters, and more, and browse through the results with smooth swipe interactions.

The project uses **SerpAPI** to fetch images from Google Image search, providing relevant images based on the user's query. The application also handles various states, such as loading, error, and no results found, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Search for Images**: Users can search for various images using keywords like "Logo for a shoe company" or "Marketing website for a vet."
- **Swipe to Like or Dislike**: Users can swipe right to like an image or swipe left to dislike.
- **Responsive and User-Friendly UI**: The app provides a simple and responsive interface with clean animations and smooth interactions.
- **Loading and Error Handling**: Displays a loading message while fetching images and provides a retry option if an error occurs.
- **No Results Handling**: Displays a message with suggestions if no images are found for the given search query.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikdev27/artistic-swipe.git
cd artistic-tinder
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
You will need a SerpAPI key to fetch images from Google Image search. Sign up for an API key here.

Once you have the API key, create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
Now, you can run the app locally:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### 5. Build for Production
To build the app for production, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
Once built, you can start the server:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-rendered web applications.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript was used to add static type checking, making the code more maintainable and less error-prone.
- **TailwindCSS**: For modern, responsive, and utility-first CSS styling.
- **SerpAPI**: A Google Image search API used to fetch images based on the userâ€™s search query.
- **ReactTinderCard**: For handling sw*ipe gestures to like or dislike images.
- **OpenAI**: For repopulating the list of candidate images based on how users had already swiped.

## Design and Architecture

- I used Next.js framework with server-less architecture. SerpAPI and OpenAI APIs should not be used on browser. So I selected Next.js framework.
- I used create-next-app to create this application.
- I didn't implement unnecessary structure to avoid over-engineering.
- And I didn't use any complex or heavy UI libraries or templates to reduce loading time and improve project performance.

---

## Extra Credit: Recommendation Engine ðŸš€

- I implemented this functionality by using OpenAI service.
- Used liked images and disliked images as input data.
- Build prompt configuration to get recommended chips from input data.
- Get chips from this service, and called SerpAPI with user query and these chips to get more images similar to the likes, less similar to the dislikes.

## Future Improvements
Image Recommendations: Implement a recommendation system that shows more images similar to the ones the user likes.
